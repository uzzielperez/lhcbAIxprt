# PersonalHF - Investment & Operations Tools

This repository contains multiple applications for investment tracking and operational assistance.

## üìà Hedge Fund Application
```bash 
streamlit run hedge_fund_app.py
```
Personal project for tracking investments and making informed decisions.

## üéâ What's Been Built

### üîß **Shifter Assistant RAG System** (`shifter_rag_app.py`)
A complete RAG application with:

**Core Features:**
- **Multi-format document ingestion**: PDF, HTML, TXT, Markdown
- **Semantic search**: Uses sentence-transformers + FAISS for vector similarity
- **Groq API integration**: Following your existing pattern from `mktaiagent`
- **Real-time Q&A**: Context-aware responses using uploaded documentation

**Advanced Memory System:**
- **Conversation history**: Automatically stores all interactions
- **Important facts storage**: Manual addition of critical information
- **Session context**: Maintains context within conversations
- **Smart retrieval**: Uses past conversations to improve current responses

### üìÅ **Supporting Files Created:**
1. `requirements_rag.txt` - All necessary dependencies
2. `.streamlit/secrets.toml` - Groq API configuration template
3. `SHIFTER_RAG_README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
4. `test_rag_setup.py` - Setup verification script
5. Updated main `README.md` - Overview of both applications

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements_rag.txt

# 2. Test setup
python test_rag_setup.py

# 3. Configure Groq API key in .streamlit/secrets.toml
# groq_api_key = "your_actual_key_here"

# 4. Run the application
streamlit run shifter_rag_app.py
```

## üß† Memory Features Explained

### 1. **Automatic Conversation Memory**
Every interaction is stored with:
- User query + assistant response
- Source documents used
- Timestamp and session ID
- Used for context in future conversations

### 2. **Important Facts Storage**
Users can manually add critical information:
- Categorized by type (safety, procedures, contacts)
- Automatically retrieved when relevant
- Persistent across sessions

### 3. **Smart Context Building**
The system builds context prompts by:
- Finding relevant past conversations
- Including applicable important facts
- Combining with document search results
- Feeding enriched context to Groq API

### 4. **Advanced Memory Options** (in documentation)
Ready-to-implement enhancements:
- **Semantic memory search**: Use embeddings instead of keywords
- **Automatic fact extraction**: LLM extracts important info from conversations
- **User profile learning**: Adapts to user expertise and preferences
- **Enhanced context injection**: Smarter memory integration

## üéØ How to Use for Shifters

1. **Upload Documents**: Drag PDFs, manuals, procedures into the sidebar
2. **Ask Questions**: Natural language queries like:
   - "What should I do if the cooling system alarm goes off?"
   - "How do I restart the data acquisition system?"
   - "Who should I contact for hardware issues?"
3. **Use Memory**: Enable conversation memory for context-aware responses
4. **Add Important Facts**: Store critical information for future reference
5. **Quick Actions**: Use preset buttons for common operational queries

## üîß Architecture Highlights

```
Documents ‚Üí Text Extraction ‚Üí Chunking ‚Üí Embeddings ‚Üí Vector Store
                                                            ‚Üì
User Query ‚Üí Semantic Search + Memory ‚Üí Context ‚Üí Groq API ‚Üí Response
```

The system intelligently combines:
- **Document knowledge** (from uploaded files)
- **Conversation memory** (past interactions)
- **Important facts** (manually stored info)
- **Groq's reasoning** (LLM processing)

## üé® UI Features

- **Clean, professional interface** with shifter-focused design
- **Three main tabs**: Questions, Memory Management, System Status
- **Real-time document processing** with progress indicators
- **Source attribution** showing which documents provided information
- **Memory visualization** with conversation history and important facts

The application is production-ready and follows your existing Groq API patterns from the `mktaiagent` project. It's designed specifically for operational environments where quick, accurate information retrieval is critical for safety and efficiency.
