## üß† **How to Test ACE Functionality**

### **1. Automated Testing**
```bash
cd /Users/uzzielperez/Desktop/lhcbAIxprt
python test_ace_functionality.py
```

**What it tests:**
- ‚úÖ ACE System Initialization
- ‚úÖ Knowledge Graph Operations  
- ‚úÖ Vision Concept Extraction
- ‚úÖ ACE Learning Capabilities
- ‚úÖ ACE Metrics and Evaluation
- ‚úÖ Feedback Learning System
- ‚úÖ ACE State Persistence

### **2. Interactive Testing with Streamlit**

#### **Launch the ACE Vision App:**
```bash
streamlit run shifter_rag_app_ace_vision.py
```

#### **Test 1: Basic ACE Learning**
1. **Go to "üí¨ Ask Questions" tab**
2. **Ask a question:** "What should I do about a 4-cells problem?"
3. **Check for ACE indicators:** Look for "üß† ACE Learning Applied" message
4. **Verify learning:** The system should show it's learning from your interaction

#### **Test 2: Vision Learning**
1. **Go to "üëÅÔ∏è Vision Analysis" tab**
2. **Upload your 4-cells problem image**
3. **Ask:** "What should I do about this 4-cells problem?"
4. **Check for ACE vision learning:** Look for "üß† ACE Vision Learning Applied" message
5. **Verify visual concepts:** System should extract visual knowledge

#### **Test 3: Knowledge Graph Growth**
1. **Go to "üß† Knowledge Graph" tab**
2. **Check metrics:** Knowledge nodes should increase after interactions
3. **View relationships:** See how visual and text knowledge connect

#### **Test 4: Expert Knowledge Integration**
1. **Go to "üß† Memory & Context" tab**
2. **Add 4-Cells Problem Knowledge:**
   - Click "üîß Add 4-Cells Problem Knowledge"
   - Add the expert procedure
   - Click "Add 4-Cells Knowledge"
3. **Test with image:** Upload 4-cells image and ask about it
4. **Verify response:** Should now include the expert procedure

#### **Test 5: Feedback Learning**
1. **Rate responses:** Use the feedback system
2. **Add expert corrections:** Provide expert knowledge
3. **Check improvement:** System should learn from feedback

### **3. Key Indicators of ACE Working**

#### **Visual Indicators:**
- üß† **ACE Learning Applied** messages
- üìä **ACE Metrics** in sidebar showing growth
- üîó **Knowledge Graph** nodes increasing
- üéØ **Learning indicators** in responses

#### **Behavioral Indicators:**
- **Responses improve** over time
- **Expert knowledge** gets integrated
- **Visual patterns** are recognized
- **Context becomes** more relevant

### **4. Testing the 4-Cells Problem Specifically**

#### **Before Adding Expert Knowledge:**
1. Upload 4-cells image
2. Ask: "What should I do about this problem?"
3. **Expected:** Generic response about the image

#### **After Adding Expert Knowledge:**
1. Add the 4-cells procedure to ACE system
2. Upload same 4-cells image  
3. Ask: "What should I do about this problem?"
4. **Expected:** Specific procedure about restarting ECAL/HCAL

### **5. Monitoring ACE Performance**

#### **Check ACE Metrics:**
- **Knowledge Graph Size:** Should grow with interactions
- **Relationships:** Should increase as system learns connections
- **Adaptations:** Should show system improvements
- **Feedback Count:** Should track learning from feedback

#### **Check Learning Indicators:**
- **ACE Applied:** Shows when learning occurs
- **Knowledge Nodes Added:** Shows new knowledge integration
- **Relationships Created:** Shows knowledge connections
- **Context Enhanced:** Shows improved understanding

### **6. Troubleshooting ACE Issues**

#### **If ACE Learning Isn't Working:**
1. **Check API keys:** Ensure Groq/OpenAI keys are configured
2. **Check memory:** Ensure conversation memory is enabled
3. **Check feedback:** Provide feedback to trigger learning
4. **Check knowledge graph:** Verify nodes are being added

#### **If Vision Learning Isn't Working:**
1. **Check vision APIs:** Ensure OpenAI/Anthropic keys are configured
2. **Check image processing:** Ensure images are processed correctly
3. **Check visual concepts:** Verify concepts are being extracted
4. **Check relationships:** Ensure visual-text connections are made

### **7. Advanced Testing**

#### **Test Knowledge Persistence:**
1. **Add knowledge** to the system
2. **Restart the app**
3. **Check if knowledge** is still there
4. **Verify learning** continues from where it left off

#### **Test Multi-Modal Learning:**
1. **Upload images** with different problems
2. **Ask questions** about each
3. **Add expert knowledge** for each problem type
4. **Verify system** learns to distinguish between problems
