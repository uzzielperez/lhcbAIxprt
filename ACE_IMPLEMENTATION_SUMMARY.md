## 🎯 How ACE Works

### 1. **Query Processing**
```
User Query → Base RAG Search → ACE Context Enhancement → Enhanced Response
```

### 2. **Learning Process**
```
User Feedback → Context Evolution → Knowledge Graph Update → Improved Responses
```

### 3. **Knowledge Graph Evolution**
```
New Knowledge → Relationship Discovery → Confidence Updates → Context Enhancement
```

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Learning Metrics
- **Total Interactions**: Number of user interactions
- **Positive Feedback**: Count of high-rated responses (4-5 stars)
- **Accuracy Improvement**: Trend in response quality over time
- **Knowledge Growth**: Rate of knowledge base expansion

### ACE Enhancement Metrics
- **Context Enhancement Ratio**: How much ACE improves base context (e.g., 5.0x)
- **ACE Applied**: Whether autonomous learning was triggered
- **Knowledge Graph Size**: Total learned knowledge nodes
- **Relationship Density**: Average connections per knowledge node

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. **Quick Start**
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements_ace.txt

# Test setup
python test_ace_setup.py

# Run demo
python ace_demo.py

# Launch ACE system
streamlit run shifter_rag_app_ace.py
```

### 2. **Integration with Existing System**
```python
# Replace your existing RAG initialization
from ace_framework import ACESystem
from shifter_rag_app_simple import ShifterRAGSystem

base_rag = ShifterRAGSystem()
ace_system = ACESystem(base_rag)

# Use ACE for queries
response, metrics = ace_system.process_query_with_ace(query)

# Collect feedback
ace_system.collect_feedback(query, response, user_rating)
```
