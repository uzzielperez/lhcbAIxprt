## üß† **ACE Learning Integration**

### **Autonomous Learning**
- **Every interaction** is learned from
- **Expert feedback** improves future responses
- **Conversation context** is maintained
- **Knowledge graph** grows with each dialogue

### **Learning Indicators**
- **"üß† ACE Learning Applied"** messages
- **Knowledge graph growth** in sidebar
- **Adaptation actions** shown after feedback
- **Evolution results** displayed

### **Expert Knowledge Integration**
- **Corrections** are integrated into knowledge graph
- **Improvements** enhance future responses
- **Visual expertise** improves image analysis
- **Procedural knowledge** becomes part of system memory

## üîÑ **Conversation Flow Example**

### **Scenario: 4-Cells Problem**

1. **User**: "What should I do about this 4-cells problem?" (with image)
2. **ACE**: Provides initial analysis
3. **User**: Rates response, asks for clarification
4. **ACE**: Provides detailed clarification
5. **Expert**: Provides correction: "Focus on 4 consecutive vertical cells"
6. **ACE**: Learns from expert input
7. **User**: Asks follow-up: "What equipment should I check first?"
8. **ACE**: Uses learned knowledge to provide better response

### **Result**: System becomes smarter with each interaction!

## üöÄ **Getting Started**
